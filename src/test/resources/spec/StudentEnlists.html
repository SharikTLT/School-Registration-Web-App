	<h1>Story 1: Student Enlists in Sections</h1>
	<p>A student enlists in sections in order to enroll for a semester. Enlistment in sections are successful as long
		as there are no issues with schedule conflicts or prerequisites.</p>
	<p>The system should not allow the student to enlist in a section if that section has prerequisites that the
		student has not taken in a previous term</p>
	<p>The system should not allow the student to enlist in a section if the schedule of that section is in conflict
		with any of the sections that the student has already enlisted in for that term.</p>

	<h2>Main Success Scenarios</h2>
	<h3>Test 1: Student successfully enlists in first section.</h3>
	<p>
		A student with student number "<span concordion:set="#studentNumber">1</span>", has not yet enlisted in any sections.
		When the student enlists in section with section ID "<span concordion:set="#sectionId">BBB222</span>", the system will
		indicate that the system has successfully enlisted in section 
		<span concordion:assertEquals="enlistInFirstSection(#studentNumber, #sectionId)">BBB222 {COM1 TBA}</span> 
		</p>

	<h3>Test 2: Student successfully enlists in second section.</h3>
	<p>
		A student with student number "<span concordion:set="#studentNumber">1</span>" is already enlisted in section
		<span concordion:set="#sectionIdCurrent">ZZZ000</span> with schedule <span concordion:set="#scheduleCurrent">TF 4pm - 5:30pm</span>.
		The student then tries to enlist in Section "<span concordion:set="#sectionIdNew">CCC333</span>", with schedule <span concordion:set="#scheduleNew">MTH 8:30am - 10am</span>
		and no prerequisites. The enlistment in the second section should be successful, and the system will indicate that section 
		<span concordion:assertEquals="enlistSuccessfullyInSecondSection(#studentNumber, #sectionIdCurrent, #scheduleCurrent, #sectionIdNew, #scheduleNew)">
		CCC333 {CS11 MTH 8:30am - 10am}</span> was successfully enlisted.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Extension Scenarios</h2>
	
	<!-- Using MultiValueResult. -->
	<h3>Test 3: Student Attempts to Enlist in Section Without Having Taken Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>
		A student with student number "<span concordion:set="#studentNumber">1</span>" attempts to enlist in section <span concordion:set="#sectionId">AAA111</span>
		of which the subject is Math 53. The prerequisite of Math 53 is Math 11 and Math 14, but the student has taken neither.
		<span concordion:execute="#result = missingPrereq(#studentNumber, #sectionId)"></span>
		The system will fail to enlist the student in section <span  concordion:assertEquals="#result.section">AAA111 {MATH53 MTH 10am - 11:30am}</span> 
		with the message "<span concordion:assertEquals="#result.message">Missing prerequisite/s.</span>"</p>
	
	<h3>Test 4: Student Attempts to Enlist in Section with Schedule Conflict</h3>
	<p>
		A student with student number "<span concordion:set="#studentNumber">1</span>" is already enlisted in section
		"ZZZ000", which has a schedule of "TF 4pm - 5:30pm". The student then tries to enlist in Section "<span
			concordion:set="#sectionId">DDD444</span>", but it "TF 4pm - 5:30pm". The system will fail to enlist the student in
		section DDD444, with an explanation that there was a schedule conflict.</p>
		<table>
		<tr><th concordion:execute="#result = scheduleConflict(#studentNumber, #sectionId)">Unsuccessful Enlistments</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
		<tr><td concordion:assertEquals="#result.section">DDD444 {PHILO1 TF 4pm - 5:30pm}</td><td concordion:assertEquals="#result.message">Conflict with sections already enlisted.</td></tr>
		</table>	
	
	<h3>Test 5: Combination of Tests</h3>
	<p>A student with student number "<span concordion:set="#studentNumber">1</span>" is already enlisted in section
		<span concordion:set="#sectionIdCurrent">ZZZ000</span> with schedule <span concordion:set="#scheduleCurrent">TF 4pm - 5:30pm</span>. 
		He then tries to enlist in the following sections:</p>
		<table concordion:execute="#result = variousCombinations(#studentNumber, #sectionIdCurrent, #sectionIdNew)">
		<tr><th concordion:set="#sectionIdNew">Section</th><th>Subject</th><th>Prerequisites</th><th>Schedule</th><th concordion:assertEquals="#result.result">Result</th><th concordion:assertEquals="#result.reason">Reason</th></tr>
		<tr><td>CCC333</td><td>CS11</td><td>None</td><td>MTH 8:30am - 10am</td><td>Pass</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
		<tr><td>AAA111</td><td>MATH53</td><td>MATH11, MATH14</td><td>MTH 10am - 11:30am</td><td>Fail</td><td>Missing prerequisite/s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>DDD444</td><td>PHILO1</td><td>None</td><td>4pm - 5:30pm</td><td>Fail</td><td>Conflict with sections already enlisted.</td></tr>
